******************************************************************************************8
Monitoring a model—especially in a production or near-production environment—is critical to ensure it continues performing well, behaves as expected, and doesn't drift over time. Here's a detailed, practical guide on how to monitor a model, tailored to both document AI and general AI models, with both no-code and low-code approaches.

📊 What is Model Monitoring?
Model monitoring is the continuous tracking of a model's performance, predictions, and behavior after deployment to:

Detect drops in accuracy.

Identify data drift or concept drift.

Catch unexpected anomalies (e.g., low confidence).

Track usage patterns and response times.

Support human-in-the-loop corrections.

🔍 Key Metrics to Monitor

Metric	Description	Applies To
Prediction Accuracy	% of predictions that match ground truth	Classification, Extraction
Field-level Accuracy	Correctness of each extracted field (e.g., invoice total)	Document AI
Confidence Scores	Monitor how confident the model is in predictions	All models
Data Drift	Change in input data characteristics vs. training data	All
Concept Drift	Change in relationship between input and output	All
Latency	Response time of predictions	All
Volume	Number of predictions over time	All
Error Rate	% of failed predictions or model errors	All
Manual Review Rate	% of predictions flagged for human review	Document AI, Human-in-loop
🛠️ Tools for Model Monitoring (By Approach)

Tool	Use Case	No-code / Low-code	Notes
Power BI	Dashboard for model predictions and performance	✅ No-code	Connect to Dataverse, Excel, Azure SQL
Power Automate	Trigger alerts, flag low-confidence, log results	✅ No-code	Use for automated monitoring
Azure Monitor / Log Analytics	Log custom telemetry from deployed models	⚠️ Low-code	Advanced enterprise monitoring
Azure ML Monitoring	Native for models deployed in Azure ML	✅ (Visual UI)	Works with model endpoints
MLflow	Log metrics like accuracy, loss, drift	⚠️ Low-code	For tracked models
Dataverse / SharePoint / Excel	Store prediction logs + audit trails	✅ No-code	Good for building custom validation flows
🧭 How to Monitor a Model — Step-by-Step Guide
✅ 1. Log Every Prediction
Log the following in Dataverse / SQL / Excel:

Model name and version

Input ID (document, customer, etc.)

Model response (predictions)

Confidence score

Timestamp

Status (Pass / Fail / Manual Review)

💡 You can use Power Automate to do this automatically after each prediction.

✅ 2. Set Confidence Thresholds
Example:

Confidence < 0.85 → Trigger manual review

Confidence > 0.95 → Auto-accept

Set rules in Power Automate or Logic Apps to flag these and log outcomes.

✅ 3. Track Accuracy (Manual or Automatic)
Compare prediction with ground truth (if available).

Calculate and store pass/fail status per prediction.

In Power BI, show:

Daily accuracy

Field-level accuracy breakdown

✅ 4. Set Up Alerts for Anomalies
Use Power Automate or Azure Monitor to:

Alert when accuracy drops

Notify when confidence falls below threshold

Raise ticket if prediction volume spikes/drops

✅ 5. Detect Data Drift (Advanced)
Use Azure Data Drift detection (in Azure ML) to:

Compare new inputs to training data distribution

Alert when the drift crosses a defined threshold

Log drift score and reasons

Low-code, but requires some setup via Azure ML datasets.

✅ 6. Visualize in Power BI
Power BI dashboards can show:

Accuracy trends

Confidence distribution

Number of predictions per model

Manual review volumes

Drift scores (if from Azure ML)

💡 Schedule auto-refresh for daily or hourly updates.

✅ 7. Retraining or Feedback Loops
If performance drops, flag model for retraining.

Store corrected outputs from human reviews.

Use them to retrain newer versions.

Trigger retraining pipelines using Power Automate or Azure Pipelines based on monitoring signals.

Go to Azure Portal > Logic Apps.

Create a new Logic App (Consumption).

Import the above JSON via "Logic App Code View" or manually build the actions in designer.

Replace:

"EXPECTED_VALUE" with a dynamic lookup or static ground truth.

Set up Azure Table Storage or Dataverse as the logging destination.

🧱 Optional Enhancements
You can easily plug into:

Azure SQL: to fetch expected ground truth

Dataverse: for richer schema and Power Platform integration

Power BI: to visualize model validation logs

Power Automate: to flag low confidence for review
