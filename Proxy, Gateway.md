2️⃣ Managing Traffic Effectively
✅ 1. Load Balancing Requests
✅ 2. Rate Limiting (Prevent Abuse)
✅ 3. Circuit Breaking (Handle Failures Gracefully)
✅ 4. Authentication & Security
✅ 5. Logging & Monitoring

1. Load Balancer
Distributes incoming traffic across multiple backend servers to ensure high availability, fault tolerance, and optimal resource usage.
2. API Gateway
Acts as a central entry point for managing API requests, handling authentication, authorization, rate limiting, and request routing.
Common Features:
✅ Authentication & Authorization (JWT, OAuth, API keys)
✅ Request/Response transformation (data aggregation, header manipulation)
✅ Rate limiting and throttling to prevent abuse
✅ Caching for improved performance
✅ Logging, monitoring, and analytics
3. Reverse Proxy
Sits between clients and backend servers to route requests, improve security, and optimize performance.
