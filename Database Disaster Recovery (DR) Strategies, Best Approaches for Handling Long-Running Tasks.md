A Database Disaster Recovery (DR) Plan ensures that your database can recover quickly and minimize data loss in case of failures like hardware crashes, natural disasters, or cyberattacks. The goal is to restore availability, consistency, and integrity with minimal downtime.

1. Backup & Restore (Simple but Slow)
2. Replication (Faster Recovery)
Master-Slave (Primary-Replica): Copies data to a secondary server in real time.
3. High Availability (Automatic Failover)
Uses tools like Patroni (PostgreSQL), Galera (MySQL), AWS RDS Multi-AZ.
4. Multi-Region DR (Geo-Replication)

Best Approaches for Handling Long-Running Tasks
1. Use a Message Queue (Best for Asynchronous Processing)
How it works:
Microservice A sends a job request to a message queue.
Worker Service (in Kubernetes) picks up the task.
The worker processes the task asynchronously and updates the database.
Microservice A can poll or use WebSockets for updates.
ðŸ“Œ Best for: Video processing, data transformation, reports, AI model training.
2. Kubernetes Jobs & CronJobs (For One-Time & Scheduled Tasks)
3. Workflows & Sagas (For Complex Multi-Step Tasks)
4. Serverless (AWS Lambda, Knative, KEDA)
