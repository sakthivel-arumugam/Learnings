We want to expand our AI platform—with its standardized APIs, monitoring, and feedback pipelines—by integrating extensions through Power Platform.
The goal is to enable non-technical users to build AI-driven solutions without needing deep coding skills, while fully leveraging our existing infrastructure.
Goals & Scope :
1.	Overall Architecture
o	Propose a generic design that integrates no-code components into our current AI workflow.
o	Outline how these workflows will interact with our standardized APIs, model monitoring, and feedback mechanisms.
o	No-code workflows should be triggered from our APIs.
o	Validation of models developed with no-code solutions should be linked to our validation pipeline (this is a part being built, we consider for the study that we have a generic pipeline to validate a range of standardized models).
2.	Alignment with Document Reading Product
o	Ensure that the proposed approach can complement and enhance our existing document reading capabilities.
Action Items:
•	Begin drafting a design document detailing the architecture and integration points for no-code workflows.
•	Propose a timeline and highlight potential dependencies.
