We want to expand our AI platform—with its standardized APIs, monitoring, and feedback pipelines—by integrating extensions through Power Platform.
The goal is to enable non-technical users to build AI-driven solutions without needing deep coding skills, while fully leveraging our existing infrastructure.
Goals & Scope :
1.	Overall Architecture
o	Propose a generic design that integrates no-code components into our current AI workflow.
o	Outline how these workflows will interact with our standardized APIs, model monitoring, and feedback mechanisms.
o	No-code workflows should be triggered from our APIs.
o	Validation of models developed with no-code solutions should be linked to our validation pipeline (this is a part being built, we consider for the study that we have a generic pipeline to validate a range of standardized models).
2.	Alignment with Document Reading Product
o	Ensure that the proposed approach can complement and enhance our existing document reading capabilities.
Action Items:
•	Begin drafting a design document detailing the architecture and integration points for no-code workflows.
•	Propose a timeline and highlight potential dependencies.

Deigning No-Code Workflows and trigger from Internal APIs
1.	Architecture Overview
a.	Trigger – Internal API to call the workflow
b.	Workflow Design Tool – Power Automate
c.	Integration Layer – Custom Connectors
d.	Data Storage – Data verse or other
e.	Actions – approval, notifications, data manipulations
2.	Technical Workflow Design
a.	Custom API – SocGen APIs
b.	Build Custom Connectors
i.	OpenAPI
ii.	OAuth 2.0
iii.	Map request/Response
iv.	Test the connector
v.	Publish the connector
c.	Design Power Automate flow
i.	Use the custom connector – webhook trigger
ii.	When an internal API makes a HTTP POST request to webhook, the workflow starts. 
iii.	Email, teams message, etc
iv.	Query/update data in Dataverse
v.	Call Additional APIs
d.	API Workflow Trigger
i.	Internal API can call the webhook endpoint generated by Power Automate.
ii.	Add headers for authentication and send payload data.
iii.	Handle Errors/retry. 
3.	Key Considerations
a.	Error Handling
i.	Try-Catch, Power Automate workflows with parallel branches
b.	Performance Optimization
i.	Batch processing, Power Automate Analytics
c.	Security
i.	Secure webkook trigger with signed JSON Web token – ensure only internal APIs can initiate the workflow
ii.	Environment variable – store sensitive data
d.	Governance
i.	Use the power platform centre of excellence (CoE)
ii.	Define role-based access controls to restrict workflow creation/execution
Benefits:
1.	Seamless Integration
2.	Empower Citizen developers
3.	Increased Agility
4.	Cost Efficient
5.	Scalability and Flexibility
6.	Improved Security
7.	Centralized Monitoring and Governance
8.	Enhanced Business Automation
9.	Reusable Components
10.	Error handling and Resilience
11.	Future-proof Design

Potential Dependencies:
1.	API Availability
2.	Authentication and Security
3.	Custom Connectors
4.	Dataverse or External Data Sources
5.	Workflow Trigger Reliability
6.	Performance and Scalability
7.	Power Automate License Limitations
8.	Monitoring and Analytics
9.	Governance Policies
10.	Interdependencies Between APIs
11.
